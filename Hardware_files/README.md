Tide_controller/Hardware_files

A add-on 'shield' designed to be used with an Arduino Uno was designed for this
project. The shield provides mounting points for the real time clock (DS3231),
buttons, indicator LEDs, resistors, and connectors to interface with the stepper 
motor controller and displays. 

See the file 'Tide_shield_notes.pdf' for more information on how this shield
is meant to be wired and used.
